### **Project Title**: OpenCV Image Processing Toolkit  

#### **Description**  
This repository contains various Python scripts and resources for image processing tasks using OpenCV. The toolkit demonstrates the application of computer vision techniques like face detection, contours, transformations, and more.  

---

### **Folder Structure**  
1. **photos/**  
   - Contains sample images for testing the scripts.  

2. **Python Scripts:**  
   - **cartoonify.py**: Converts an image into a cartoon-like version.  
   - **contours.py**: Detects and highlights contours in an image.  
   - **draw.py**: Draws geometric shapes on an image using OpenCV functions.  
   - **face.py**: A basic script for face recognition.  
   - **facedetect.py**: Detects faces in images using the Haar Cascade Classifier.  
   - **imgclr.py**: Manipulates image colors and filters.  
   - **laps.py**: Implements Laplacian edge detection.  
   - **opcv.py**: General OpenCV functionalities and experiments.  
   - **transformations.py**: Applies transformations like rotation, scaling, and translation to images.  

3. **Resources:**  
   - **harface.xml**: Haar Cascade XML file for face detection.
